"""
Curation advisor (D55, post-v1.0): what to put in DX Monitor's Needed list.

DX Monitor's Needed list is curated by hand (its device holds 30 entries), and
each entry is paired with a HamAlert trigger. This module suggests the entries
most likely to pay off. It never writes to DX Monitor; Dan adds what he wants.

Entities (never credited, Missing Entities):
  * left out when a confirmation is already in hand for Mixed: an "awaiting
    credit" mark or a paper card. A "won't submit" mark does NOT remove one:
    that confirmation will never be credited, so a new contact is still needed.
  * DXpeditions first (on the air, then starting within 30 days, from the
    DX Monitor tags of D54), then Club Log Most Wanted, easiest first.

Band slots (entities already credited for Mixed), one suggestion per entity:
  * bands: the profile's bands that Dan has left ticked in the advisor's band
    filter (D57; default everything but 160 m and 6 m, Dan 2026-10-14: too hard
    from EM83 for this purpose); modes: CW, Phone, Digital.
  * continents: only entities on continents left ticked (D57; default all).
  * a slot is left out when it is awaiting credit or covered by a paper card,
    as above; won't-submit slots stay in.
  * if the entity still needs a band AND a mode, the suggestion is "those bands
    with those modes": every spot DX Monitor matches is a contact worth 2
    credits (one band + one mode, Dan's credit rule). Otherwise it is the needed
    bands with any mode, or the needed modes on any band: worth 1.
  * order: credits per contact, then Most Wanted easiest first.

Names are HamAlert's spellings, because DX Monitor matches spots by HamAlert's
entity name (trimmed and lower-cased, nothing else). HamAlert uses Club Log's
DXCC data, whose names are the ADIF names in our reference table; Dan checked
all 63 of his needed entities plus 15 unusual or renamed ones in HamAlert's
picker (2026-10-20). Two differ — HamAlert keeps the old names — and are listed
in data/hamalert_overrides.csv.

Modes in DX Monitor's terms: Phone = ssb, Digital = ft8 + ft4 (DX Monitor
offers cw, ssb, ft4 and ft8, the four HamAlert trigger modes).
