"""
DX Monitor DXpeditions (D54, post-v1.0) — optional.

When Dan enters DX Monitor's address in Settings, the app reads two of DX
Monitor's endpoints, read-only:

  GET /api/adxo     {"updated", "entry_count", "entries": [{"id", "dxcc",
                     "callsign", "begin", "end", "active", "qsl", "source",
                     "info"}]}   — "dxcc" is an entity NAME as ADXO spells it;
                     expired entries are already removed by DX Monitor.
  GET /api/watched  {"count", "entries": [{"id", "callsign", "dxcc",
                     "source_adxo_id", "note", "added", ...}]}
  GET /api/needed   {"count", "entries": [{"id", "entity", "band", "mode",
                     "note", "added", ...}]}  — D55, optional; "entity" is
                     HamAlert's spelling, band/mode comma-separated, blank = any
                     (checked against DX Monitor commit 98161c7, 2026-10-20)

(Checked against DX Monitor commit 6950a24, 2026-10-13.) Nothing is ever
sent to DX Monitor. /api/adxo also feeds the Propagation Dashboard, so this
module only reads it.

ADXO names are matched to DXCC entity numbers without guessing: exact match on
the LoTW or ADIF name after a conservative normalisation and a few standard
abbreviations, then a tested built-in alias list (data/adxo_aliases.csv), then
names Dan has approved in Settings. A name that still doesn't match is listed
in Settings with a suggestion for Dan to approve; it is never applied on its
own, and its DXpeditions simply get no tag until then.

Every response is validated before use; on any failure the caller keeps the
last good copy and says when it was obtained.
